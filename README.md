# Colour Palette Generator
This is a simple application for users to create a list of colours with names
and generate random colour palettes from their own curated selections.  
The idea is if you want to create a limited style palette, or generate a strange 
colour palette, you can do so with this application.

### Features
- Create a list of colours with names
- Generate random colour palettes from your list
- Save and load your colour lists
- Export palettes to png files

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Pillow
- Currently, pyQt5, but will be ported to PySide6 in the future

<!-- pip freeze > requirements.txt -->
Requirements will be updated as the project progresses.
